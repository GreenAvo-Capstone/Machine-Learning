The dataset is intended for training and testing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, specifically leveraging the ResNet-50 architecture, to achieve automatic classification of avocado images based on their maturity level. The ultimate objective is to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between raw, half-ripe, and ripe avocados from images.
